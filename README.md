KNN_glass_identification_A_10.ipynb 

You are provided with a dataset from USA Forensic Science Service
which has description of 6 types of glass; defined in terms of their
oxide content (i.e. Na, Fe, K, etc). Your task is to use K-Nearest
Neighbor (KNN) classifier to classify the glasses.
The original dataset is available at
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/glass+identification). For
detailed description on the attributes of the dataset,
please refer to the original link of the dataset in the UCI ML
repository.
But the shared drive folder have the dataset for your convenience

perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset using Python Pandas,
including dropping irrelevant fields for predicted values, and
standardization of each attribute.
Following data cleaning, two Scikit-Learn KNN models should be created
for two different distance metrics: Square Euclidean and Manhattan
distance. The performance of the two models using different distance
metrics should be compared in terms of accuracy to the test data and
Scikit-Learn Classification Report.

For the data "Social_Network_Ads.csv", we have tried fitting model with below mentioned classification algorithms and the results were compared.,
Logistic Regression,
K-NN,
SVM,
Decision Trees,
Random Forest
